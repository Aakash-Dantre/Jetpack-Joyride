Terminal based jetpack joyride for DASS assignment



## prerequisite
- ttictoc library

## Movement

- A for left
- D for right
- W for activating the jetpack
- space for bullets
-  t for sheild
- When ‘W’ is released, the jetpack deactivates and gravity comes into play.
- Q for quit

## Background and Scenery

- The scenery and the obstacles must change as you move in and out of the window. There must be
    a ground/platform and the sky, and the Mandalorian can’t go below the ground or above the sky.
- Lots of coins suspended which the Mandalorian can collect and increase his score.

## Obstacles 

- Fire Beams: Beam like structures should appear (like in the figure above) as obstacles. There
    must be three kinds of beams: horizontal, vertical and some at 45◦with the ground/platform. 


- Magnet: A magnet should randomly appear on the way, which will influence the motion of the
    Mandalorian. So if he is in the range of the magnet, he would be continuously attracted towards
    the magnet.

## The Boss Enemy!! 

- The boss enemy will have multiple lives, which will decrease when the Mandalorian shoots bullets
    at it. Once the boss enemy is defeated, Baby Yoda can be rescued and the game is complete.

## Score and Lives

- Score is displayed on the top equals to number of coins taken.

- Both time and the lives of the Mandalorian are limited. So the ’time remaining’ and ’lives remain-
    ing’ must be displayed on the top along the score. End the game when all lives are over, or if the
    user quits by pressing ’Q’.

## Power-Ups 

- Speed boost: The speed of the game will increase upon taking this power-up. 
- Shield: A shield should appear around the Mandalorian using which, he will not be affected by
    the enemies and obstacles. The shield will be activated using the ’Space’ key and will last for 10
    seconds. It will take 60 seconds for shield power-up to refill again after use.

- Dragon
    - Ultimate Dragon: We need a dragon on our side too :)
    - Drogon PowerUp will pop up once in the middle of the game and will be destroyed only on
       contact with an obstacle or enemy.
